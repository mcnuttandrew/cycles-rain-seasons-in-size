          This graphic tells a small story about bicycle traffic on the Fremont
          bridge in Seattle Washington through the course of 2018. It does so
          using a traditional graphic (a line chart), a fashionable but unusual
          chart (a sunburst), and novel chart type (the table cartograms nested
          into a treemap). The table cartogram encodes tabular data through the
          areas of a grid while maintaining the adjacency of that grid and
          keeping everything bound within a rectangle, which imparts the
          irregular shapes to the rectanges. This unusual graphic arises
          from-but is considered only in passing by-academia. We make a table
          cartogram of each of the months in the year and place them in a
          proportionately-sized treemap. From this combo we are able to see a
          number of dimensions and granularities simultaneously: the relative
          popularity of travel during the weekend to the workweek, that no one
          rides during thanksgiving, that the Fremont bridge is mostly
          uncorrelated with the University of Washington's academic calendar,
          and the popularity of summer compared to winter.

          The table cartogram is a close relative of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram"
            >geographic cartogram</a
          >
          (a type of visualization which embeds data through the area of bodies
          in a map) although cast into an abstract, or non-geographic, light. It
          is also related to a wide family of area encoding visualizations like
          the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_plot">mosaic plot</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart">the pie chart</a>,
          <a
            href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2008/engaging-readers-with-square-pie-waffle-charts"
            >the waffle plot</a
          >, and many others. Table cartograms provide an interesting advantage
          over many of these alternatives in that the fiercely maintained grid
          offers a two dimensional relationship which is either entirely
          unavailable or can become highly distorted in other contexts. While
          they might seem cartoonishly inappropriate in many settings, they
          offer a <a href="https://xeno.graphics">xenographic</a> effect that is
          (hopefully) visually interesting while presenting part-to-whole data
          in an insightful manner. I believe that table cartograms have an
          interesting future: they seem to be most useful for presentational
          graphics where order is intrinsic to the data (like the calendars seen
          here), they are likely useful for textile physicalizations of
          visualizations (such as perhaps in quilts), and perhaps other new and
          wonderful contexts.

          The library that produces the table cartogram in this work can be
          <a href="https://github.com/mcnuttandrew/table-cartogram"
            >found here</a
          >. This graphic was produced by combining data published by the
          <a
            href="https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k"
            >city of Seattle</a
          >
          and historical weather data from
          <a href="https://darksky.net/">Darksky</a>. It makes use of a lot of
          custom javascript code
          <a href="https://github.com/mcnuttandrew/cycles-rain-seasons-in-size"
            >(which you can view here)</a
          >
          to calculate layout and positioning,
          <a href="https://github.com/uber/react-vis">react-vis</a> for
          rendering, and sketch for visual tuning. This graphic is meant for
          print. To this end, it is formatted in such a way that, if you are
          interested you can print it out on your home printer, and it will look
          as intended.
